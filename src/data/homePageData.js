                        description: 'We\'re quickly approaching the time of year when GoPro traditionally launches a new flagship action camera. And while GoPro Hero 10 Black rumors are thin on the ground right now, it\'s surely preparing something special for the tenth edition of its Hero range.\r\n\r\nAt least, that\'s what we\'re hoping. After all, despite some strong competition from rivals like the DJI Osmo Action and Insta360 One R, the main line GoPros still tend to deliver a best-in-class combination of usability, image quality and stabilization. \r\n\r\nThe big improvements in last year’s GoPro Hero 9 Black included a higher resolution sensor, a longer battery life and a front screen for on-the-fly framing. It\'s the most vlogging-friendly camera GoPro has made so far. \r\n\r\nBut GoPro can do better in 2021. In this article we’ll look at what we think GoPro will bring to the Hero 10 Black, plus some features that are suggested commonly online that we don’t think will happen, and why. \r\n\r\nGoPro Hero 10 Black release date and price\r\n\r\nGoPro has announced a new Black-series flagship action cam in late September or early October every year since the Hero 5 Black landed in 2016. Given this was not pushed back in 2020, despite the pandemic, we\'re expecting GoPro to keep the same launch window in 2021. \r\n\r\nThere are currently no Hero 10 Black pricing leaks, but we don’t expect to see a big change from the Hero 9 Black’s original $449.99/£429.99/AU$699.95 pricing. However, if the new camera launches at the same price this may feel like a hike, as GoPro dropped the price of the Hero 9 Black slightly in January 2021. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the changes we may see to justify the upgrade.',

The Sony A7 III still holds up very well, even today, but the A7 IV is more advanced in just about every way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sony A7 IV carries on the same tradition as the A7 III, combining 4K video capture with high-speed 10fps continuous shooting, but adds in a 36% increase in resolution, up from 24.2MP to 33MP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should allay any misgivings amongst full frame camera buyers that the A7 III’s 24MP might not be enough – that resolution is, after all, the same as many far cheaper APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 33 million pixels, though, the A7 IV establishes a clear gap to lesser APS-C rivals.',

And while there\'s still some time for the Korean conglomerate to introduce the Galaxy A53, rumors have already started doing rounds on the Internet, with the latest one talking about the phone\'s colors.\r\n\r\nAccording to GalaxyClub, the Galaxy A53 will come in at least four colors - black, white, light blue, and orange. However, Samsung might offer more options after the smartphone is launched in Q1 2022.',

                        description: 'The Huawei Nova 9 has been confirmed for a European launch in 2021, sporting a 50MP flagship-grade camera according to Huawei. The tech giant has been launching plenty of smartwatches, laptops, monitors and tablets over the last year, but its smartphone launches have slowed right down, which isn’t too surprising given the fact its devices don’t feature Google services. This makes the Nova 9 launch a bit surprising, especially given the fact we are still waiting for a global launch of the flagship Huawei P50 – successor to the Huawei P40 Pro series yet. \r\n\r\n• Best Huawei phone in 2021\r\n\r\nThe Nova series has always represented a more midrange positioning than the Huawei Mate series or P series (with the most recent to launch in the UK being the Nova 5T), however, the Nova 9 comes loaded with some impressive specs.\r\n\r\nHuawei wants the Huawei Nova 9 to be positioned as a flagship smartphone for the younger generation when it launches for a European audience, so the phone is sleek, slender and lightweight – skinny jean ready. It’s available in Black and Starry Blue and measures just 7.77mm thin, weighing 175g.',

And while it didn\'t launch in the first half of 2021 as some rumors claimed, it\'s apparently still on track to become official before the end of the year.\r\n\r\nIn fact, according to the newest rumor out of China, we should expect the foldable to be announced in November. It will allegedly have an 8" foldable internal display with 120 Hz refresh rate and LTPO technology, which probably means it will be made by Samsung. The phone will be powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 888, which is a strange move considering the timing - the successor to the 888 should be unveiled in December, with one or two phones for the Chinese market running it already being made official by the end of this year.',

The Sony A7 III still holds up very well, even today, but the A7 IV is more advanced in just about every way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sony A7 IV carries on the same tradition as the A7 III, combining 4K video capture with high-speed 10fps continuous shooting, but adds in a 36% increase in resolution, up from 24.2MP to 33MP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should allay any misgivings amongst full frame camera buyers that the A7 III’s 24MP might not be enough – that resolution is, after all, the same as many far cheaper APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 33 million pixels, though, the A7 IV establishes a clear gap to lesser APS-C rivals.',

The Sony A7 III still holds up very well, even today, but the A7 IV is more advanced in just about every way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sony A7 IV carries on the same tradition as the A7 III, combining 4K video capture with high-speed 10fps continuous shooting, but adds in a 36% increase in resolution, up from 24.2MP to 33MP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should allay any misgivings amongst full frame camera buyers that the A7 III’s 24MP might not be enough – that resolution is, after all, the same as many far cheaper APS-C mirrorless cameras. With 33 million pixels, though, the A7 IV establishes a clear gap to lesser APS-C rivals.',

The Tokina ATX-M f/1.4 23mm, 33mm and 56mm are already available for Fujifilm X mount cameras, so this should come as welcome news for Sony shooters looking for a set of affordable primes. \r\n\r\nIf this super-fast set of primes for the best Sony cameras are anything like the Fujifilm variants (which we expect they will be, as they just have a different mount) we can expect them to have an aperture range of f/1.4-16, making them perfect for low light photography. They should also include a multi-layer lens coating to suppress light flares and ghosting, and have a de-clickable aperture ring for silent, smooth transitions when using the lens for video.',
