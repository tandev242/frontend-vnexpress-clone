The Sony A7 III still holds up very well, even today, but the A7 IV is more advanced in just about every way.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sony A7 IV carries on the same tradition as the A7 III, combining 4K video capture with high-speed 10fps continuous shooting, but adds in a 36% increase in resolution, up from 24.2MP to 33MP.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis should allay any misgivings amongst full frame camera buyers that the A7 III’s 24MP might not be enough – that resolution is, after all, the same as many far cheaper APS-C mirrorless cameras.

                        description: 'We\'re quickly approaching the time of year when GoPro traditionally launches a new flagship action camera. And while GoPro Hero 10 Black rumors are thin on the ground right now, it\'s surely preparing something special for the tenth edition of its Hero range.\r\n\r\nAt least, that\'s what we\'re hoping. After all, despite some strong competition from rivals like the DJI Osmo Action and Insta360 One R, the main line GoPros still tend to deliver a best-in-class combination of usability, image quality and stabilization. \r\n\r\nThe big improvements in last year’s GoPro Hero 9 Black included a higher resolution sensor, a longer battery life and a front screen for on-the-fly framing. It\'s the most vlogging-friendly camera GoPro has made so far. \r\n\r\nBut GoPro can do better in 2021. In this article we’ll look at what we think GoPro will bring to the Hero 10 Black, plus some features that are suggested commonly online that we don’t think will happen, and why. \r\n\r\nGoPro Hero 10 Black release date and price\r\n\r\nGoPro has announced a new Black-series flagship action cam in late September or early October every year since the Hero 5 Black landed in 2016. Given this was not pushed back in 2020, despite the pandemic, we\'re expecting GoPro to keep the same launch window in 2021. \r\n\r\nThere are currently no Hero 10 Black pricing leaks, but we don’t expect to see a big change from the Hero 9 Black’s original $449.99/£429.99/AU$699.95 pricing. However, if the new camera launches at the same price this may feel like a hike, as GoPro dropped the price of the Hero 9 Black slightly in January 2021. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the changes we may see to justify the upgrade.',

                    description: 'We\'re quickly approaching the time of year when GoPro traditionally launches a new flagship action camera. And while GoPro Hero 10 Black rumors are thin on the ground right now, it\'s surely preparing something special for the tenth edition of its Hero range.\r\n\r\nAt least, that\'s what we\'re hoping. After all, despite some strong competition from rivals like the DJI Osmo Action and Insta360 One R, the main line GoPros still tend to deliver a best-in-class combination of usability, image quality and stabilization. \r\n\r\nThe big improvements in last year’s GoPro Hero 9 Black included a higher resolution sensor, a longer battery life and a front screen for on-the-fly framing. It\'s the most vlogging-friendly camera GoPro has made so far. \r\n\r\nBut GoPro can do better in 2021. In this article we’ll look at what we think GoPro will bring to the Hero 10 Black, plus some features that are suggested commonly online that we don’t think will happen, and why. \r\n\r\nGoPro Hero 10 Black release date and price\r\n\r\nGoPro has announced a new Black-series flagship action cam in late September or early October every year since the Hero 5 Black landed in 2016. Given this was not pushed back in 2020, despite the pandemic, we\'re expecting GoPro to keep the same launch window in 2021. \r\n\r\nThere are currently no Hero 10 Black pricing leaks, but we don’t expect to see a big change from the Hero 9 Black’s original $449.99/£429.99/AU$699.95 pricing. However, if the new camera launches at the same price this may feel like a hike, as GoPro dropped the price of the Hero 9 Black slightly in January 2021. \r\n\r\nHere are some of the changes we may see to justify the upgrade.',
